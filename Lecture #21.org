 - Merging multiple object modules into a larger object module
  - Relocate any absolute addresses in the code with their load points
   - TLP (text load point) and DLP (data load point)
    - TLP initialized at 400K, DLP at 10M
   - Loop through all the OM
    - Append text and data onto the global text and global data, respectively 
 - Resolve external references to external definitions
   - Go through each table (rel table, ref table, def table, sym table)
    - For every entry, add it to the global version of the tables with the
      address offset by the appropriate load point 
    - As we go through the rel table, we have to update the location in the
      text/data blocks with the appropriate load points 
    - Update TLP and DLP based on the size of the text and data areas 
   - Loop through the global ref table
    - If the entry has a match in the global def table
     - Update the line of code that used the reference with the address from
       the global def table 
     - Remove the entry from the global ref table 
    - Otherwise, just continue 
   - If the global ref table is empty after the previous loop, mark file as
     executable 
    - To run on the command line, you need a global def table entry for main  
* Hardware 
 - Use voltage to measure binary 
  - Time vs Voltage (like a graph) 
   - Impossible to keep the voltage at any exact point 
   - We have a threshold between 1 and 0  
    - Actually we have 2 thresholds 
     - Top section is 1, middle is error, bottom is 0
