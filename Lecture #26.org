* Decoders
 - Always draw the decoder as a box 
 - Min-term generating machine 
 - 2-to-4 decoder
  - 2 inputs, 4 outputs
   - Have a function for each column (wire) on the truth table
  - E is enable, we want regular output when E is 1, all 0s when A is 0
   - Can accomplish this by ANDing enable with the rest of our function
    - Functions as a kind of "door"
  - *Implementing a decoder diagram on physical notes*
   - Also for a 3-to-8 decoder 
* Multiplexer (MUX)
 - n - select inputs
  - Treat select inputs as an n bit binary number 
 - 2^n data inputs
  - Label 0..2^n-1
 - 1 output
 - Call this 2^nx1 MUX
  - Data input to output multiplexer
 - Uses select inputs to pick the input wire that corresponds to the select
   value and send that wire's data to the output
 - *Check physical notes for MUX example*
 - You can never take multiple input wires, tie them together, and assume the
   output would be correct
   - This is due to non-true zero voltage, binary being a threshold
