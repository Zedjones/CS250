* Standard Forms
 - Sum of product
  - Expression with product terms OR'ed together
 - Product of sum
  - Expression with sum terms AND'ed together
 - *Check physical notes for examples*
* Types of terms
 - Min term
  - Product term with all variables in the problem
 - Max term
  - Sum term with all variables in the problem
 - Complements are separate from normal terms for both of these
  - 2^3 possible combinations for 3 terms
 - Relating to truth tables
   | A B C | NOT A AND NOT B AND C  | A AND B AND C |

   | 1 1 1 | 0                      | 1             |
   - One min term for each row, where it is 1 and every other row is 0
    - Max term is the opposite of this 
     - 0 for one row and 1 for everything else 
   - *Look at physical notes for the rest of this* 
   - Given any function, we can build a 2 level circuit for it 
    - Not necessarily the smallest function to implement F
* Extra Gates 
 - NAND
  - NOT(A and B)
 - NOR
  - NOT(A OR B)
 - XNOR
  - NOT(A XOR B)
 - Pass result of regular gate through the inverter 
  - However, there is a better way to do this with gates
 - *Check physical notes for symbols*
