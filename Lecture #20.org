* Exam
    Definitely need to know the two passes and what they do
    Look at the handout we got on Monday
* Process of assembler
** Each label's address is the number of bytes previously written to buffer
** Data location counter and text location counter (DLC and TLC)
    Text block offset by 400,000; data by 10,000,000
    T for text, D for data during assembly
** .global
*** external reference
    label you use but other file defines
*** external definition
    something you define that others use
* Process of a linker 
** Two major jobs (just need to know this for exam)
*** Merging multiple object modules together to generate a new module
*** Resolve external references to external definitions
